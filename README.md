# A Logical Approach

a) Testing to see if it works.
- number 1
- number 7

b) Solve $\sqrt{2x + 2} - \sqrt{x - 3} = 2$

c) **The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

d) Which of the shaded regions in thee Venn
diagrams illustrates the set $P^{1} \cup Q^{1}$?


k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}

\textbf{\textit{ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS}}\\
\textit{All working must be clearly shown. Marks will not be awarded for correct answers without corresponding  working}\\
1. In the city of Kwadaso, 60 people own \textbf{cats}, \textbf{dogs} or \textbf{rabbits}. If 30 people owned \textbf{cats}, 40 owned \textbf{dogs}, 10 owned \textbf{rabbits} and 12 owned exactly two of the three types of pet. How many people own all the three?\\

2.(a) Express $\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{4 - \sqrt{3}}$ in the form $a + b\sqrt{3}$

(b) Solve $\sqrt{2x + 2} - \sqrt{x - 3} = 2$

(c) Find the \textbf{square root} of $7 + 4\sqrt{3}$

3. (a)  If a $\ast$ b = $a^2$ – 2ab, where $\textbf{a, b} \in  \textbf{R}$. Find a if a  $\ast$ 4 = 9

(b) The operation * is defined on the set Q, of rational numbers by a * b = $\frac{ab}{a + b}$, a + b $\neq$ 0. Show whether * is associative or not.\\

4. Let * be a binary operation defined on the set Z of integers by a * b = a + b + 2 for all a, b Z.
   
i. Show that * is commutative and associative.
ii. Find the identity element with respect to Z.
iii. Find the inverse of a Z.

6. (a) Show that the function $f(x) = \frac{x - 3}{x + 2}$ is one – to - one.\\ 

(b) Find the largest possible domain of the function $k(t) = \sqrt{t + 4}$\\

(c) Find the range of the function $f(x) = \frac{x - 1}{x + 2}$\\

6. If $f(x) = 3x - 2$ and $g(x) = x^2$, find;\\
i. $(f + g)(2)$\\
ii. $(f – g)(2)$\\
iii. $(fog)(2)$\\
iv. $(gof)(-2)$\\

7. Three functions are defined on he set of real numbers by $f(x) = 2x + 1$, $g(x) = 3x – 2$ and $h(x) = x + 5$. Show that $(fog)oh = fo(goh)$\\

8.  If $f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{x - 3}$, find $f^{-1}(x)$\\

9. Solve $x^2 = 13x - 36 = 0$\\

10.	In a survey of 100 out-patient who reported at the hospital one day, it was found out that 70 complained of \textbf{Fever}, 50 complained of \textbf{Stomach} ache and 30 were \textbf{Injured}. All 100 patients had at least one of the complaints and 44 had exactly two(2) of the complaints. How many patients had \textbf{all three(3) complaints}?
